Iterative Bubble sort algorithm and Recursive Bubble sort algorithm
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bubble sort algorithm is similar to Selection sort. It has a comparison of neighboring elements. The comparison starts from the first element of the list with the second element.

  – If the first element is larger, swap their places.
  
  – If the first element is smaller, move on to the second as the main one for comparison.
  
  Bubble sort characteristics:

  – Time complexity O(n²).

  – Space complexity In-place O(1).

  – Stable algorithm.

  – Internal sort algorithm.

  – Iterative and recursive algorithm.
